## OVERVIEW
In this project, we have developed a skin detection model utilizing game theory. We have taken into account six color spaces as players in the game, namely HSV, YCRCB, LAB, CMYK, RGB, and LUV. Each player has the option to choose between two strategies: "collaborate" and "not collaborate." The gain of each player is represented by the F1-score metric.
